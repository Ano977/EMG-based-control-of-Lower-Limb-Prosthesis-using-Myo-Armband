# EMG-based-control-of-Lower-Limb-Prosthesis-using-Myo-Armband
For detailed information about the project, please refer to the paper titled 'EMG based Control of Transtibial Prosthesis'(DOI:10.5220/0009464200740081)
The Myo armband was used for the extraction of data. 
The uploaded folder contains three matlab script files. One for checking the working of the armband. Second for the trained clasfier and third for the real-time control of prosthesis.
